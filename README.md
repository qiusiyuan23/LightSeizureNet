# LightSeizureNet
LightSeizureNet (LSN), a lightweight and highly interpretable seizure detection model with dilated convolution, global average pooling and kernel-wise pruning for model compression. The LSN model can also provide fine-grained information such as the activated brain region and the frequency of brainwave during seizures for clinical diagnosis.
